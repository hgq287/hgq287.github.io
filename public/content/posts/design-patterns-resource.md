# Essential Resource: Software Design Patterns

This post shares a highly recommended resource for learning about **Software Design Patterns**: [Refactoring.Guru: Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns).

## What are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are documented, reusable solutions to common problems encountered in software design. They act as `blueprints` that you can customize and apply to solve a particular design challenge in your code, helping you write more maintainable, flexible, and robust software.

## Key Information You Will Find

The resource provides a comprehensive catalog of 22 classic design patterns, categorized by their intent:

1.  **Creational Patterns:** Focus on object creation mechanisms. (e.g., Factory Method, Singleton, Builder)
2.  **Structural Patterns:** Deal with object composition and class structure. (e.g., Adapter, Decorator, Facade, Composite)
3.  **Behavioral Patterns:** Concerned with the communication between objects and the assignment of responsibilities. (e.g., Observer, Strategy, Command, Chain of Responsibility)

## Why Learn Patterns?

Learning these patterns provides a "toolkit" of solutions and defines a common language that helps development teams communicate design concepts more efficiently.
