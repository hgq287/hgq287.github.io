## **Senior Solutions Architect | Hands-on Engineering Leader**
*I don't just draw diagrams; I build systems that work.*

With 15+ years of experience, I specialize in owning complex systems from the first line of code to production. I believe the best architects are the ones who still get their hands dirty with code. My expertise covers Native macOS/iOS, Mobile Cross-platform, full-stack web ecosystem, Cloud Infrastructure, and recently, AI-assisted development workflows. My focus is always on resilience, performance, and team velocity.

### **Work Experience**

#### **Hands-on Architect** | Mobile, Machine Learning & Backend
*May 2025 – Present (Part-time / After-hours)*

* **Roadmap:** Led a team of 3 to build and launch a mobile app and its backend system.
* **Infrastructure:** Designed and deployed a lean, GCP-based mobile backend from scratch, maintaining 99% uptime.
* **Efficiency:** Reduced development rework by ~ 25% through proactive design reviews and spotting architectural bottlenecks early.
* **AI Integration:** Introduced AI-assisted code reviews, reducing manual rework by 25% and helping the team ship features faster.

#### **Systems Architecture** | Mobile Ecosystems | Varin Team
*Jan 2024 – Apr 2025 (Part-time / Execution Focus)*

* **Strategy:** Owned the technical direction for multi-platform shopping systems, balancing native performance with cross-platform delivery speed.
* **Custom Solutions:** Developed custom **Native Bridges** in Swift and Kotlin to bypass framework limitations and access platform-specific hardware capabilities.

#### **Senior Engineering** | macOS Productivity Suite  
*2015 – Present (Full-time)*

* **Long-term Ownership:** Owned the core architecture of professional macOS apps for over a decade.
* **Legacy Modernization:** Led the strategic migration from Objective-C to **Swift/SwiftUI**.
* **Results:** 35% reduction in crash rates and slashed the time-to-market for new features by half.
* **Scale:** Integrated AWS Chime for high-concurrency real-time communication within the native desktop app.

#### **Independent Work** | System Design & Open Source

* **SnifLeaf (Owner):** Designed and built a native macOS network inspector using SwiftUI and NetworkExtension to solve the bloat of traditional debugging tools.
* **Trading Systems:** Developed automated execution engines, owning the full pipeline from market data ingestion to real-time risk management.

#### **Early Career & Foundation**

* **Business Venture | F&B Entrepreneur (2013 - 2014):** Learned the "Real-world Ownership". Managed P&L, staff of 10+, and crisis handling. This experience taught me to build software that actually solves human/business problems.
* **PHP Developer | Mecsu JSC:** Managed company websites and internal tools using PHP and Wordpress.
* **Embedded Software Engineer | Datalogic:** Developed firmware for barcode scanners and optimized retail hardware systems.
* **Internship | Renesas Design Vietnam:** Research and development during thesis, focused on hardware/software co-design.

### **Leadership Philosophy**

* **Lead by Doing:** I write the core code and review the rest. I never assign a task I can't do myself.
* **Pragmatic AI:** Use AI to eliminate "busy work" (documentation, boilerplate, unit tests), so the team can focus on architecture.
* **Extreme Accountability:** I take full responsibility for the systems I build, from the first line of code to 3 AM production stability.

### **The Discipline**
I apply the same discipline to my work as I do to my life. **Daily running and meditation** aren't just hobbies - they are how I maintain the focus and mental endurance needed to lead teams through stressful technical decisions.

> **Note:** I believe strong technical leadership is earned through real work. I stay hands-on in critical parts of the code to ensure our architecture remains practical and efficient.
