## Technical Expertise
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

I believe in using the right tool for the job. My experience spans from building intuitive user interfaces to managing scalable backend systems and integrating machine learning.

### Core Development
* **Web:** I specialize in building performant apps using **TypeScript**, **React**, and **Next.js**. On the server side, I typically work with **Node.js (NestJS)** or **FastAPI**. 
* **Mobile:** I enjoy building native experiences with **SwiftUI** for iOS and macOS, but I’m also comfortable using **React Native** or **Flutter** when a cross-platform approach makes more sense. 
* **Data & CMS:** I have deep experience with **WordPress** (custom themes and plugins) and managing various databases like **MySQL**, **MongoDB**, and **SQLite**. 

### AI & Machine Learning
*I focus on making AI practical and deployable, not just theoretical.*
* **Frameworks:** I use **Scikit-Learn**, **TensorFlow**, and **CoreML** to build and integrate models directly into applications. 
* **Solutions:** I leverage **Google VertexAI** and **AWS AI services** to handle complex tasks like data pre-processing and risk management in ML pipelines. 

### Infrastructure & Ecosystem
* **Cloud & DevOps:** I manage environments on **AWS** and **Firebase**. To keep applications scalable and reliable, I use **Kubernetes**, **Docker**, and automated **CI/CD** pipelines. 
* **My Workflow:** Most of my work happens in a **macOS** environment. I rely heavily on **Git** for collaboration and feel right at home in the **Terminal**.

> **Beyond Coding:** I value technical mentoring and Agile teamwork. For me, the goal isn't just to write code, but to build products that solve real problems.
