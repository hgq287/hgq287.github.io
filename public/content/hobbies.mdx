I believe that a clear mind leads to better code. I dedicate time every day to stay physically and mentally fit.

* **Running:** Builds the discipline and resilience I need to tackle complex engineering challenges.
* **Meditation:** Sharpens my focus, helping me make better decisions in architecture and communication.
* **Yoga:** Keeps me adaptable and grounded, both physically and mentally.

These practices are more than just hobbies—they are the tools that help me lead and collaborate effectively in a professional environment.
