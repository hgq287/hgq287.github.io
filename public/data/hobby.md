## 🧘‍♂️ Beyond Code: My Hobbies
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

While I spend much of my time crafting software and solving technical challenges, I also dedicate time daily to my personal well-being.

- 🏃 **Running** helps me build discipline, mental clarity, and resilience — the same qualities I bring into my code.

- 🧘 **Meditation** sharpens my focus and brings mindfulness into my decision-making, whether it's architecture design or team communication.

- 🧎 **Yoga** keeps me grounded and adaptable - a reminder to stay flexible both physically and mentally.

These practices aren’t just hobbies - they’re essential tools that enhance how I show up, collaborate, and lead in both personal and professional spheres.
