Cloud Strategy & Infrastructure
Bridging Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and AWS core services to build cost-effective, secure systems:

Compute & Serverless: Orchestrated scalable backends using Google Cloud Functions and App Engine, alongside distributed Python engines on AWS EC2.

Real-time Data: Leveraged Firebase/Firestore for seamless synchronization and high-availability mobile experiences.

Data Tier: Implemented Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL) for reliable transactions, paired with Redis for sub-second data retrieval.

Security First: Hardened environments via strictly defined IAM policies and secure Networking to ensure enterprise-grade safety.
