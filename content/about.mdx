## Hi, I'm a Solutions Architect & Full-Stack Engineer
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

With over 10 years of experience, I help businesses and startups transform ideas into high-performance, scalable applications. My journey has covered everything from real-time communication systems and financial tools to crypto trading bots and native mobile apps.

I believe that great software isn't just about code - it's about clean architecture, long-term maintainability, and a seamless user experience. Whether starting from scratch or scaling an existing product, I focus on delivering real value on time.

Outside of engineering, I maintain a daily habit of running and meditation. These practices reflect the consistency and discipline I bring to my work every day.

**Let's build something great together.**
