## Featured Projects
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

I believe in building tools that solve real development bottlenecks. Most of my projects are open-source and focused on improving workflow efficiency.

### SnifLeaf – Native Network Inspector
*Apr 2025 – Present | macOS & iOS*
**[View on GitHub](https://github.com/hgq287/SnifLeaf)**

SnifLeaf is an open-source HTTPS proxy tool designed for developers and QA engineers who need to analyze network traffic in real-time. I built this from scratch using **SwiftUI** and **NetworkExtension** to provide a lightweight, native alternative to Charles Proxy.

* **The Problem:** Many network debugging tools are heavy or have complex UIs that slow down the development cycle.
* **The Solution:** A high-performance app that gives you full visibility into request flows and API behavior without the overhead.
* **Tech:** Swift, SwiftUI, Combine, NetworkExtension.

A versatile Python toolkit and RESTful API built to handle the "small but frequent" tasks that data engineers face daily.

* **Core Features:** Seamlessly converts between JSON, CSV, Excel, and Feather formats while tracking API call history. It also includes quick utilities for RGB-to-HEX conversion and technical note management.
* **Designed for:** Scalability and ease of integration into existing data pipelines.
* **Tech:** Python, FastAPI, Pandas.
