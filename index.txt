10:T19a5,<h2><strong>I build and architect high-performance systems.</strong></h2>
<p><em>Focused on hands-on leadership and ownership-driven engineering.</em></p>
<p>With over 10 years in the industry, I specialize in owning complex systems from the first line of architecture to final production delivery. I believe that the best technical decisions are made by staying close to the code, ensuring that every architectural choice is practical, scalable, and stable under pressure. My expertise spans native macOS/iOS development, cross-platform mobile strategies, and resilient backend infrastructures.</p>

<h3><strong>Core Expertise</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>End-to-End Ownership:</strong> I take responsibility for the balance between rapid delivery and long-term system maintainability.</li>
<li><strong>Execution &amp; Delivery:</strong> I lead technical roadmaps by clearing blockers and ensuring teams ship high-quality software in remote environments.</li>
<li><strong>The Tech Stack:</strong> Deep experience in <strong>Native Swift (macOS/iOS)</strong>, <strong>Flutter/React Native</strong>, and <strong>Node.js/Python</strong> backends. I prefer building systems that are simple to manage but hard to break.</li>
<li><strong>Technical Mentorship:</strong> I align teams through technical credibility and hands-on guidance, focusing on clean standards and proactive design reviews.</li>
