## 🎯 a Solutions Architect with over 10+ years of full-stack experience
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

I’m a Full-Stack Software Engineer and Solutions Architect with 10+ years of experience helping businesses and startups turn ideas into reliable, high-performance applications. I’ve built real-time chat systems, video calls, Kanban boards, financial tools, crypto trading bots, and mobile apps using **Swift, Objective-C, Vue.js, Next.js, React Native, Flutter, Go, TypeScript, NestJS, and Python.**

Certified in Agile methodologies and AWS cloud solutions, I bring a strong foundation in scalable system architecture, clean code principles, and cloud-ready deployments.

Whether you need to develop from scratch, improve existing features, or scale your product, I focus on clean architecture, smooth user experience, and long-term maintainability. I’m easy to collaborate with, deliver on time, and always aim to bring real value to your project.

I also maintain a daily running and meditation habit (tracked on Strava), which reflects the consistency, discipline, and long-term focus that I bring to my engineering work.

Let’s build something great together!
