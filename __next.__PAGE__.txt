4:T19a7,<h2><strong>I build and architect high-performance systems.</strong></h2>
<p><em>Focused on hands-on leadership and ownership-driven engineering.</em></p>
<p>With over 10 years in the industry, I specialize in owning complex systems from the first line of architecture to final production delivery. I believe that the best technical decisions are made by staying close to the code, ensuring that every architectural choice is practical, scalable, and stable under pressure. My expertise spans native macOS/iOS development, cross-platform mobile strategies, and resilient backend infrastructures.</p>
