4:T1b3f,<h2><strong>Senior Solutions Architect | Hands-on Engineering Leader</strong></h2>
<p><em>I don&#39;t just draw diagrams; I build systems that work.</em></p>
<p>With 15+ years of experience, I specialize in owning complex systems from the first line of code to production. I believe the best architects are the ones who still get their hands dirty with code. My expertise covers Native macOS/iOS, Mobile Cross-platform, full-stack web ecosystem, Cloud Infrastructure, and recently, AI-assisted development workflows. My focus is always on resilience, performance, and team velocity.</p>

<hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #e0e0e0; width: 50%; margin: 0;" />

<h3><strong>Leadership Philosophy</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lead by Doing:</strong> I write the core code and review the rest. I never assign a task I can&#39;t do myself.</li>
<li><strong>Pragmatic AI:</strong> Use AI to eliminate &quot;busy work&quot; (documentation, boilerplate, unit tests), so the team can focus on architecture.</li>
<li><strong>Extreme Accountability:</strong> I take full responsibility for the systems I build, from the first line of code to 3 AM production stability.</li>
</ul>
<hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #e0e0e0; width: 50%; margin: 0;" />

<h3><strong>The Discipline</strong></h3>
<p>I apply the same discipline to my work as I do to my life. <strong>Daily running and meditation</strong> aren&#39;t just hobbies - they are how I maintain the focus and mental endurance needed to lead teams through stressful technical decisions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I believe strong technical leadership is earned through real work. I stay hands-on in critical parts of the code to ensure our architecture remains practical and efficient.</p>
